      <h1>What We're About</h1>
      <p>
        BJJ Gear Inc. was established to create innovative products made with
        high-quality materials for the Jiu Jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA)
        athlete. We love Jiu Jitsu, we love MMA, and we love participating in
        the culture and industry we are a part of. What we do is a result of our
        passion for the art, sport, and lifestyle of the athletes we serve.
        Every Jiu Jitsu Gi we design is a direct result of our motto and
        passion. Made with quality materials and built for the athlete, a BJJ
        Gear Inc. Gi is always recognizable on the mat. Complete with unique
        artistic design, our products have become a statement of defiance, but
        also of benevolence. Our vast artistic Jiu Jitsu Gi collections reflect
        the true message of our sport. The BJJ Gear Inc. mission is to elevate
        the sport and lifestyle of mixed martial arts through our innovative
        products while promoting the Jiu Jitsu way of life. One who wears BJJ
        Gear Inc. is born to win, determination is in their blood and inevitable
        success is in their future.
